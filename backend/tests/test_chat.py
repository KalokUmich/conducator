"""Tests for WebSocket chat functionality with multi-client support.

SECURITY NOTE: The WebSocket protocol now implements server-side credential assignment:
1. On connect, backend sends {type: "connected", userId: "<uuid>", role: "host/guest"}
2. First client in room becomes host, subsequent clients become guests
3. All messages use backend-assigned userId and role
